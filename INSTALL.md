# Installation Instructions


##Â Manual

For Linux / OS X / Windows this process can be followed. We assume you have
the `git` tool installed.

1. Change Directory to Sublime Text packages directory:
    + Mac OS X: `cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/`
    + Linux: `~/.Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/`

2. Pull directory into Packages folder.
    + SSH: `git pull git@github.com:lordqwerty/TamarinAssist.git`
    + HTTPS: `https://github.com/lordqwerty/TamarinAssist.git`

3. Open Sublime and bottom right syntaxes Tamarin should be in the list.

Please check back to see what changes have been made so you can perform a
`git pull`.

*Please note: Windows will be able to perform syntax highlighting and autocompletion but not built in functions. This is because the Tamarin Prover is not supported under Windows.*
